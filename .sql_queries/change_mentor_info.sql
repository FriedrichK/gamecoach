I''ll introduce myself. My name is Alex and my nickname is EthereaL.GhoSt (just simply call me Ghost). I''m a 17 years old competitive player from Romania and my dream is to become a professional player. I am currently the midlaner of Team Deadlyus and we are at the moment competing in JoinDotaLeague and will also compete in some Starladder Amateur Series. We also wanted to go to ESL Qualifiers but we missed it and we''re planning to go to Eizo and BigPoint. Also in the near future we will participate at Dreamhack Bucharest.\n\nAbout Mentoring, I have some friends new into DotA and I tried to explain how things go around here to them and they said I should be a mentor because of my calmness and willing to teach you so I listened to them and here I am. I can coach any role except hard support and I can coach any skill level(from beginner to very advanced) to make you become a better player.\n\nAs a side note, you can find further details about me here:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2jhwzr/etherealghost_coaching_all_skill_levels_d/", "steamIdLink": "https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075999488", "response_rate": null, "response_time": null}' WHERE id = 93;
